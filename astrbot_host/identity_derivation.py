"""Derive the pinned V2 identity from the account and persona the operator chose.

Single-target mode used to ask the operator for four things it could work out
itself: the bot, the role, the platform and the conversation target. V1 needed
them because it let one installation hold several bots. A single-bot installation
does not, and asking anyway is what made first-run configuration read as a
chore -- the operator was told to open the plugin config and copy in values the
host already had.

So the identity is derived instead, from the two facts only the operator can
know:

* **which account** is doing the talking (the OneBot login, ``self_id``), and
* **which persona** it should speak in.

Everything here is a pure function over those two strings plus the platform id.
Keeping it pure matters: the values land in ``StagingConfiguration``, which is
fingerprinted and pinned on disk, so a derivation that could vary between two
calls would look like a profile conflict rather than a bug.

``bot_id`` and ``role_id`` are the memory-ownership keys. Deriving them from the
account and the persona -- rather than the shared ``staging-bot`` / ``staging-role``
constants -- means two installations on different accounts no longer write into
one role, and the same persona under two accounts stays two roles.
