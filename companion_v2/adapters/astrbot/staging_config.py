# all-fields rule each of those took the whole installation offline, and the operator saw
# only "connection failed".

# ``scope`` carries platform/account/bot/participant/conversation; ``subject`` is the
# person; ``persona`` is the Bot/persona/role identity. Its instruction hash is content,
# not identity: editing the same AstrBot persona must not require rebinding the chat.

# the platform opening a different conversation -- an ordinary thing a person does, and
